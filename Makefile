# Build, install, and run Demo on a physical iPhone from Terminal only —
# no need to open Xcode.app, aside from the one-time account setup noted below.
#
# Quick start:
#   make devices                        # find your iPhone's identifier
#   make deploy se2                     # build + install + launch on device named "se2"
#   make deploy DEVICE_ID=<identifier>   # build + install + launch
#
# One-time prerequisite (can't be avoided, it's an Apple requirement, not an
# Xcode one): your Apple ID must be added under Xcode > Settings > Accounts
# at least once, so the system has a personal signing team to build with.
# After that, everything below is pure command line.
#
# If your Apple ID has more than one team, pass TEAM_ID explicitly:
#   make deploy DEVICE_ID=<identifier> TEAM_ID=<team id>
# Find your Team ID with:
#   security find-identity -v -p codesigning
